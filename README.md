<h2>How to start this project:</h2>

    <li>Start the project</li>
    <li>Now it will be available at <b>localhost:8080</b></li>
</ul>
<h2>Endpoints:</h2>
<ul>
    <li>localhost:8080/parking/parkcar/manual?height=CAR_HEIGHT&weight=CAR_WEIGHT - you have to enter car values manually</li>
    <li>localhost:8080/parking/parkcar/automated?amountOfCars=CAR_AMOUNT - you have to only proceed car amount and it will generate as much cars as you write to the url (I recommend not to exceed the 1000 cars per request, otherwise it will take too much time)</li>
</ul>
